Over the previous decade, , the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. this search for exoplanets have been among the most exciting topic in contemporary astrnomy; and NASA's Kepler program has provided the means to advance this field further than previously thought possible. 
The elegant logic behind Kepler's methodology is that Exoplanets have no light of their own, and their transit in front of their home stars would cause a small barely perceptible drop in the stars' light emissions. 
This methodology has led to large quantities of image data  covering hours of observations waiting for the chance that a distant star  might  register a tell-tale blip in its light emissions.
